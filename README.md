# Smart-Tabs
The official Smart Tabs App GitHub Repository

You will find here the newest releases for the app (also accessible through the app itself!)

# Warnings
The app in its current form isn't signed and will most probably be flagged by any anti-virus. Donations (here!) help in the continued development of the app and for us to be able to afford any code signatures needed.

In the effort to be as transparent as possible regarding this issue, you can check out (this) video where I go through the steps to download and compile the problematic scripts so you can analyze the code and use your own compiled version for peace of mind.
## If you do not wish to watch the video, here is a quick step-by-step tutorial:
  1-Close Smart Tabs if it is already running
  
  2-Pull the code found in the repository (autoit-helper.au3 and smart-tabs-launcher.au3)
  
  3-Download [AutoIt v3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) 
  
  4-Navigate to where you installed AutoIt
  
  5.1-Open the Aut2Exe folder
  
  5.2-Open Aut2Exe.exe
  
  6.1-In the **Source** section, select the autoit-helper.au3 file
  
  6.2-In the **Destination** section, navigate to where Smart Tabs is installed ("C:\User\Program Files\Smart Tabs" by default) and select the "**resources**" folder
  
  6.3-Name the file **autoit-helper** (**<-- VERY IMPORTANT**)
  
  6.4-Tick the "Compile For System" box
  
  6.5-Let the conversion happen
  
  7-Repeat step 6 **IN FULL** converting the **smart-tabs-launcher.au3** script to the **same destination folder** naming it **"smart-tabs-launcher"** 
  
  8-Launch Smart Tabs
